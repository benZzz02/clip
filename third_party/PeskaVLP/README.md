# **[NeurIPS 2024] Procedure-Aware Surgical Video-language Pretraining with Hierarchical Knowledge Augmentation**
_Kun Yuan, [Vinkle Srivastav](https://vinkle.github.io/), Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy_,  **NeurIPS 2024** 

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arxiv-2307.15220-red)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00263) [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zuwpeRkJNH&noteId=IgTHiK4DS9)



This repo contains an open source PyTorch distributed training code for: 
- Medical Image Analysis paper: [Learning Multi-modal Representations by Watching Hundreds of Surgical Video Lectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15220) [1]
- MICCAI'24 paper: [HecVL: Hierarchical Video-Language Pretraining for Zero-shot Surgical Phase Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10075) [2]
- NeurIPS'24 Spotlight paper: [Procedure-Aware Surgical Video-language Pretraining with Hierarchical Knowledge Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00263) [3]

This repository provides an implementation using PyTorch and ffmpeg with a reasonable number of GPUs. The training code was runned on the French public AI cluster Jean-Zay, which is managed by the SLURM system, and also supports single GPU training. We extend our gratitude to the community for their prior contributions, which have been instrumental in developing this project: [MIL-NCE](https://github.com/antoine77340/MIL-NCE_HowTo100M) and [DeCLIP](https://github.com/Sense-GVT/DeCLIP)

## Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch (>= 2.0)
- [python-ffmpeg](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) with ffmpeg 
- mmengine==0.7.0
- torchvision
- numpy<2
- torchmetrics
- pycm
- fvcore
- transformers==4.30.2
- scikit-learn
- tqdm


## Step1: Prepare Data
To create your own dataset, follow the structure of the 'data' folder. Each sub-folder is organized as follows:
- Training:
  - videos: store the video in .mp4 format
  - whisper_narration_texts: store the narration texts from OpenAI Whisper for each video
  - aws_narration_texts: store narration texts from AWS Medical Transcribe for each video
  - keystep_texts: store keystep texts for each video
  - abstract_texts: store abstract texts for each video
  - splits: csv files that sprcify which videos are used for training or validating for clip-/keystep-/video-level of pretraining
- Evaluation:
  - prompts: class prompts for downstream datasets
  - downstream_datasets:
    - CholecT50-challenge-train: data downloaded from [CholecT50](https://github.com/CAMMA-public/cholect50/blob/master/docs/README-Downloads.md)
    - cholec80:
      - csvs: annotation files for each video
      - frames: frames named as {video_id}_{frame_id}.png (download and extract in 1 FPS from [Cholec80](https://github.com/CAMMA-public/TF-Cholec80))
    - autolaparo
      - csvs: annotation files for each video (download from [Autolaparo](https://autolaparo.github.io/))
      - frames: frames named as {video_id}_{frame_id}.png

## Step2: Prepare Config File
Before runnig the code, you need to create a folder and init a 'config.py' file. Examples are given in the 'configs' folder.
- ./configs/surgvlp/config.py : the configuration to the [1]
- ./configs/surgvlp/hecvl.py : the configuration to the [2]
- ./configs/surgvlp/peskavlp.py : the configuration to the [3]

## Step3: Training Your Own Model
The following command line trains the surgical vision-language model on a single node for [1,2,3]. It uses all of its GPU and save the model checkpoints in the directory configs/'surgvlp/hecvl/peskavlp', the log is created and written in the *log.txt* directory. A 'tensorboard' directory is created and logs are recorded inside. '--resume' allows you to automatically find the last checkpoint and resume from that when your training is interrupted, you can always set it True.

SurgVLP [1]:
```python
python train.py --resume --work_dir=./configs/surgvlp/
```

HecVL [2]:
```python
python train_hierarchy_ssl.py --resume --work_dir=./configs/hecvl/
```

PeskaVLP [3]:
```python
python train_hierarchy_ssl.py --resume --work_dir=./configs/peskavlp/
```
